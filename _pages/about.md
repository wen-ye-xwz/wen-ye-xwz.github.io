I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at University of Southern California (USC) advised by <a href='https://xuezhemax.github.io/'>Prof. Xuezhe Ma</a>. My current research focuses on **vision language models**. I was fortuanate to work with Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/yanliu-ai/home'>Prof. Yan Liu</a> on time series foundation models. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor degree from University of Wisconsin - Madison in Computer Science, Data Science, and Statistics. During the time at Madison, I worked with <a href='https://datascience.wisc.edu/staff/gao-song/'> Prof. Song Gao</a> on research topics related to Geospatial Data Science. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:yewen@usc.edu">yewen@usc.edu</a>.
