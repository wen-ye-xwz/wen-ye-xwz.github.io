* Modified the Non-Maximum Suppression Algorithm to update boundaries of regional tiles to prevent overlap which makes the downstream task of scoring trips within regions easier
* Investigated the data quality issue regarding trip duplication and created a scrip to flag trips that are duplicate by trip id (duplicate trips by collection) or by geolocation-trail and timestamp (semantically duplicate trips)

* Set up a data pipeline and built enriched trip dataset with urban/rural features using Sedona and Spark
* Designed and implemented an algorithm to detect user relocation by examining their trips, determining change in dwelling locations, and peaks in their traveling distances
